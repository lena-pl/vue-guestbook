## Laravel and Vue Guestbook tutorial

This is my work following a Vue.js tutorial on laracasts.com and practicing new skills I recently learned, such as working with Gulp and Laravel Elixir and using npm to pull in different libraries.

This project is built on the Laravel framework, which is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
